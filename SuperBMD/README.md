# SuperBMD
A tool for converting various formats into BMD/BDL (Model format of some of Nintendo's GameCube and Wii games).

This API uses the Open Asset Import Library (AssImp). A list of supported model formats can be found [here](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_features_formats.html). Recommended: .dae/.fbx.

This is a fork of SuperBMD that supports generating triangle strips (a more space-efficient way to represent faces in a model) 
and extracting and applying BMD material data as JSON, maintained by Yoshi2 (RenolY2 on github). <br>
Please report any issues you find here: https://github.com/RenolY2/SuperBMD/issues Please add any source files that are useful to recreating the issue.<br>
New compiled releases (and their source code) are found here: https://github.com/RenolY2/SuperBMD/releases

# Usage

SuperBMD.exe can be used to convert models to the BMD format and BMD models to the DAE format.

To convert a model, drag it onto the executable or run the program via command line:

`SuperBMD.exe <model path>`

If model path is a BMD, it will be converted to DAE, its textures will be dumped as .PNG and 
its material data will be dumped as JSON in the same folder as the DAE and the textures.

If model path is a model but not BMD, it will be converted to BMD. By default triangle strips 
are generated for static meshes but not rigged meshes. See below for more options on this.

# Full usage
`SuperBMD.exe <input path> [output path] [--mat <material path>] [--outmat <material path>] [--texheader <texheader path>] [--tristrip (all/static/none)] [--rotate] [--bdl] [--profile] [--nosort] [--onematpermesh]`<br>
Arguments in square brackets are optional. If output path is left out it is created from the input 
path by replacing the extension either with `.bmd`, `.bdl` or `.dae`, depending on input. 
  
* If input path is BMD then the extracted DAE is written to output path. Textures are dumped to 
the same directory as the DAE. 
* If input path is not a BMD, the model is converted into a BMD and written to output path. If output path ends with ``.bdl`` and the ``--bdl`` option is set, or output path is empty and ``--bdl`` is set, the model is converted to BDL.  
* If input path is a BMD/BDL and output path is a BMD, behaviour is similar to if the input was not a BMD/BDL.

Any model -> BMD/BDL:
* If --mat material path is set, loads material data from that path (See "Materials" further down in this document)
* If texheader path is set, loads texture header info from that path (See "Texture header info" further down in this document)
* ``--tristrip none`` generates no triangle strips. ``--tristrip static`` generates triangle strips only for static models (no rig). 
``--tristrip all`` generates triangle strips for all models (static and rigged), currently triangle strips on rigged models are buggy though. 
If omitted, the default mode is generating triangle strips only for static models.
* ``--rotate`` rotates the model so that Y is up instead of Z. Default is no rotation. Doesn't have an effect if model is rigged.
* ``--bdl`` is necessary for when you want to create a BDL instead of a BMD. 
BDL supports the same features as BMD but has an additional data section for precompiled display lists.
* If ``--nosort`` is set, disable naturalistic sorting of meshes by name. (Sorting makes sure so that 
e.g. mesh-0 appears before mesh-1 in the model)
* If ``--onematpermesh`` is set, ensure that the user uses only one material per mesh. This can be 
useful for models for which the game needs to access specific meshes in the model for features, e.g. 
the tropical shirt of Mario in Super Mario Sunshine, as it avoids the creation of additional unintended 
meshes due to use of multiple materials on a single mesh. (When a mesh uses several materials, Assimp 
breaks it up into several meshes, one for each material)
* If ``--texfloat32`` is set, forces 32 bit float values to be used for UV coordinates. 
This can be necessary sometimes when 16 bit fixed point isn't enough precision.
* If ``--degeneratetri`` is set, triangle lists will be written as triangle strips with 
the use of degenerate triangles. This is less space-efficient than writing triangle lists 
but can be necessary in rare cases where the game renders triangle strips and refuses to render 
triangle lists. 

BMD/BDL -> DAE:
* If --outmat path is set, write the material data to that path, otherwise write it into the same folder as the created dae. 
* If ``--profile`` is set, then do not do any conversion. Instead, print information about the BMD/BDL such as section sizes, textures 
and other useful information that tells you more about what is taking up so much space in your model. Useful for optimization.
* If ``--exportobj`` is set, creates an .obj file instead of a .dae file.
* None of the other options have an effect.

## Notes
### Modeling
* When exporting a model for conversion to BMD, rotate the model about the X axis by -90 degrees. 
Most modeling programs define the Z axis as the up axis, but Nintendo games use the Y axis instead. 
Rotating the model ensures that the model is not sideways when imported into a game. Alternatively, 
set the --rotate option when calling SuperBMD.exe which will rotate the model appropriately without you having to do it. <br>
If your model is skinned, then rotation isn't necessary if the skeleton is rotated correctly.

### Skinning
* SuperBMD supports both skinned and unskinned models.
* For skinned meshes, <b>make the root of the model's skeleton the child of a dummy object called 
  `skeleton_root`.</b> SuperBMD uses the name of this dummy object to find the root of the skeleton 
  so that it can process it.
* If a `skeleton_root` object is not found, then the model will be imported with a single root bone. 
This is recommended for models intended for maps. If your model is skinned but does not have a `skeleton_root` 
then an error will be thrown.

### Vertex Colors
* SuperBMD supports vertex colors on two channels.

### Textures
* SuperBMD supports models that have no textures. These models will appear white when imported into a game.
* It is recommended that the model's textures be in the same directory as the model being converted. <b>
If SuperBMD cannot find the model's textures, it will throw an error message with the path to the texture it couldn't find.</b>
* Textures must be in BMP, JPG, PNG or TGA format.

### Mipmaps
* SuperBMD supports extracting and importing mipmaps
* When converting BMD to DAE, mip textures are created by appending ``_mipN`` to the texture name, where N is the
mip level starting with 1, if a BMD contains mip textures.
* When converting from another format into BMD, the maximum mip level of a texture is detected by searching for textures
with ``_mipN`` at the end, starting with 1. The mip textures are automatically loaded based on that.
* When using a Texture Header json file, correct MinLOD, MaxLOD and LODBias settings are necessary for mipmaps to be displayed correctly 
ingame. The LOD refers to the mip level, with 0 being the main, most detailed texture and values > 0 being the mip levels or between two mip levels.
* The MinFilter (Min stands for Minification) for a texture in the Texture Header json file defines how a texture is filtered when it is far away. 
A setting of ``LinearMipmapLinear`` is used for linear blending of two mip levels.
* Each mip level should be half the size of the previous level and the texture size should be a power of two (e.g. 32, 64, 128, 256...).

### Converting BMD to DAE 
When you drop a BMD on SuperBMD.exe, it will be converted into DAE. When you import the DAE into 3DS Max,
in the Import options that appear you need to go into Advanced Options->Units, uncheck "Automatic" and set 
File units converted to Meters. Otherwise the imported dae will be very big.

### Materials
* This fork of SuperBMD allows dumping and inserting materials as JSON and it allows additional 
textures to be loaded without having to apply them in a 3D modelling program. Look at Full Usage 
above on how to extract and apply material files. Writing bat files is recommended.

* The mat json file will contain one or more materials from the BMD file. When applying materials, the material 
names are exactly the name of the materials of the model when exported from a 3D modelling program. 
You do not have to cover every material, SuperBMD will generate material data for the rest. You can 
also use a default material setup for every material in the model by naming the material in the JSON ``__MatDefault``. 
You can define a default material for a category of materials: If a material entry in the json is named ``__MatDefault:Category``, 
then every material in your model that contains the word ``_Category`` (note the underscore) will have that material applied to it.

* The ``TextureNames`` section contains the names of the textures used by the material. Usually the 
first texture is the main texture, the rest are used for graphics effects. When using a ``__MatDefault`` 
material it can be useful to leave the first texture name as ``null`` so each material will retain the 
texture name it originally had.

* Additional textures can be loaded by adding their names in the ``TextureNames`` section of a material. 
The program will search for these textures in the folder of the material file by appending an extension to 
the name in this order: ``.png``, ``.jpg``, ``.tga``, ``.bmp``. (Example: If there are two textures 
``Texture.png`` and ``Texture.bmp``, the PNG texture will be loaded rather than the BMP texture)

* You can modify materials if you know what you are doing. Look on the internet for info on the GX API 
(Useful: TevStage, TevOrder, AlphaCompare, Blend) and  check the source code of SuperBMD for possible values 
for some of the enums (When viewing the source code in VS or other good IDEs, check ``SuperBMDLib/source/Materials/Material.cs``). 
A recap of all enums and useful info about materials will be available here https://github.com/RenolY2/SuperBMD/wiki when 
it is added.

* In BMD->DAE conversion materials in the DAE are differently named compared to how they are named in the material json or the BMD.
Blender will also try to append ``-material`` to the end of the material names when exporting DAE. SuperBMD will try to 
mitigate this when you use a material json file: When it manages to match up a material from the model with a material in the json, 
the material will be renamed to the name from the json. This preserves original material names and helps in cases where 
the game applies e.g. BTK or BRK files that look for a specific material name in the BMD.

### Material presets
This release has some bat scripts that apply some included materials.
* sms-toon: This provides toon shading for Super Mario Sunshine.
* sms-shiny: Based on the toon shading material, this gives the model a shine but without the toon. Known to work with SMS.
* pikmin2-simpleshading: Creates basic light/shades on a model. Known to work with Pikmin 2.

These material presets are not always the best and you are encouraged to find other 
presets by experimenting with material data from models and making new scripts. 
You can combine options if wanted. For example, you can add the --rotate option 
from superbmd_rotatemodel.bat to the other bat scripts if you want shaded and rotated models, 
or you can add the --bdl option from superbmd_createbdl.bat to the other scripts for shaded BDL models.

### Billboarding
You can billboard an entire mesh by adding BillXY (billboard on both axes) or BillX (billboard only on X axe) to a mesh name.
If your mesh is part of a skinned mesh, it is recommended for the billboarded mesh to be weighted entirely towards one bone.

### Texture header info
When dumping BMDs to DAE you will find a texheader json file. It contains some data from the BTI headers of 
the textures stored in the BMD. Of note are the Format (sets the texture format) and the WrapS/WrapT (affects 
the way UV maps will wrap when going beyond the edges) attributes. They are applied in a similar way to materials,
using --texheader to specify the path to such a file. Header data is applied to textures with a matching name. 
Please note: If you use a texture header file then the file needs to contain the headers for all the textures you are using in the model.

Supported texture formats: I4, I8, IA4, IA8, RGB565, RGB5A3, RGBA32, and CMPR. 
Supported wrap modes: ClampToEdge, Repeat and MirroredRepeat 
When using I4 or I8, note that intensity equals alpha.

Textures can be specified in the texture header file multiple times. In that case the texture data is stored only once 
but multiple headers are written. Different instances of the texture are referenced by the material in the material json file.
Example: ``texture:1`` means that the material references the second instance of a texture named ``texture`` inside the texture header file.
